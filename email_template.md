**About "Bottle Rocket Sunsets":**
I released this as a single last week. I wrote this track near the river banks of the Blanco river, in Central Texas. I wrote it reminiscing about growing up swimming with family and friends on the Blanco river. I attempt to capture the golden haze of childhood summers including lawn chairs by the creek, rope swings, and first love. It's a wistful tribute to growing up, growing older, and never forgetting where you came from.
