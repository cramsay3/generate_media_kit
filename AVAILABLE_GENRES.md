## Recommendations

Based on your current style (indie pop, singer/songwriter, rock, folk-pop, acoustic, indie, chillwave), you could potentially expand to:

1. **POP** - Many pop playlists might accept indie-pop crossover
2. **ROCK** - Alternative rock, indie rock, soft rock
3. **FOLK** - Already matching, but more available
4. **ACOUSTIC** - Already matching, but more available
5. **SINGER/SONGWRITER** - Already matching, but more available
6. **ALTERNATIVE** - Alternative rock/pop
7. **COUNTRY** - If your music has country elements
8. **JAZZ** - If your music has jazz elements

## Next Steps

To expand the campaign, you could:
1. Add more genre keywords to `config.yaml` (e.g., "pop", "rock", "alternative")
2. Remove some exclusions if appropriate
3. Run the campaign again with expanded filters

Would you like me to update the config with additional genre keywords?
